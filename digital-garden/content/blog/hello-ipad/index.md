Is it possible to remotely create content, even on devices previously thought of as consumption only? Yes. It is possible.

## Why does content production matter?

There are over 7 billion people on the planet, and growing. The vast majority of them have access to devices that are geared toward consumption only. But we are all creators. We all have stories to tell.

Every single device, in every single hand, is capable of producing content and sharing experiences. And when you share experiences, you share knowledge.

A connected world, finally able to collaborate in realtime. It's a vision. It's a goal.

But most of all, it's an inevitable conclusion to humanity's tribe that is ever growing, ever learning, ever reaching.

Welcome to the new world of content creation.
